## 👋 Hi, I’m Czar

I like to introduce myself through **five “I”s**:


### 🔬 I explore
I have rich research experience in **both Experimental and Theoretical Chemistry**, with a strong focus on bridging physical intuition, mathematical structure, and computation.


### 🎓 I studied
- **B.S. in Chemistry**, *summa cum laude* (**GPA: 4.0/4.0**)  
- **University of California, San Diego**  
- Double minors in **Mathematics** and **General Biology**


### 🧪 I research
I am currently a **first-year Ph.D. student at Princeton University**, studying  
**Theoretical & Computational Chemistry** and **Experimental Biophysics**.

My research interests include:
- Applied Mathematics  
- Electronic Structure Theory  
- Molecular Simulation  
- Statistical Mechanics  
- Materials Science  


### 🎨 I create
Beyond academics, I enjoy creative work in:
- 🎵 Music composition  
- ✍️ Poetry  
- 🎨 Digital painting  

Selected works are available on **SoundCloud** and other creative platforms  
(*links coming soon*).


### ⚽ I move
I love sports and staying active—it keeps my thinking sharp and balanced.

> *Science sharpens my thinking; art keeps it human.*
